# 🏦 Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction (k-NN Model)

This project predicts whether a banking customer will accept a personal loan using k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). Built using Python and RapidMiner, it includes full preprocessing, model tuning, and business evaluation.

## 📊 Key Goals
- Convert depositors to loan customers
- Predict loan acceptance with optimized k
- Evaluate performance with precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, GridSearchCV)
- RapidMiner (visual ML workflows)
- StandardScaler, k-NN Classifier, Confusion Matrix
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall

## 📂 Project Files
- `UniversalBank.csv` – Dataset with 5,000 customer records
- `Personal Loan Acceptance Project.pdf` – Final report with insights
- `Personal_Loan_Acceptance_Python_FIXED.ipynb` – Python notebook with k-NN implementation and optimization
